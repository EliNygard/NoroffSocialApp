 * Submits a comment on a specific post.

 * an alert is shown to the user, and the form is reset.
 * If an error occurs during the submission process, it is logged and an alert is shown. After submission, the user is redirected to the home page.

 * @param {Event} event - The form submission event.
 * @param {number} postId - The ID of the post to which the comment is being added.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when the comment is submitted or an error is caught.
 *
 * @throws {Error} Will throw an error if there is an issue adding the comment to the API.
